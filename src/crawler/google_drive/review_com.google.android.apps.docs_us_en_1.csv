Reply to dev: i had a favorite pdf viewer until drive took over. I used drive for storage but then the drive pdf viewer made it so I could no longer set a default and had to choose every time I open a pdf,1,4,2.20.381.05.46,2020-10-16 22:38:44,"Hi, Jim. Google Drive is mainly for file storage. If the Drive PDF Viewer app cannot provide a preview to a certain size and type of file, you might need a third party app to interact with particular type of files such as PDF.
