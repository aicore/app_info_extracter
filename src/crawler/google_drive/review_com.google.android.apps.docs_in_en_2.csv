Don't trust the sync system to work properly. ---TLDR ---- Pro: GDrive, is a relative cheap back up solution, that has the benefit of being secured by Google. These are the good points. Uploading files is relatively easy, though you do need keep a note as some files it has issues uploading. In the event that you intentionally have duplicate files, they will be ignored (so be careful when uploading your own albums). ----Con:---- GDrive will fail to download large numbers of pictures or back ups to empty folders on your computer, if using Backup and Sync. (Even following online help does not aid this issue) -- In the event you move your back up repo from one computer to another (or have to reinstall windows), you will have to reupload all your content again.(See below for details) -- If you have photos on GDrive which are shared with GPhoto, they only take up the memory of your upload ONCE (so 20MB of photos will be be a 20MB storage despite being in both locations. This is a good thing.). You will have to delete them from both in order to reclaim the memory. -- GPhotos makes this challenging. It is difficult to navigate the folder structure on GDrive or find out data about the contents of a folder. --------------------------------------- Why the nightmare (for those interested) Over the years I backed up my photos and videos to Google Drive. Recently I've had to reinstall windows. This is where the pain began. Point to note: I have a slow upload speed uploading videos can be an overnight job or even multiple days and so I would want to avoid repeating. --------1 - Linking my old folders back to GDrive, results in it trying to upload everything again. This is understandable from a programming perspective, so I went to GDrive and moved the older saved over to the new location with the hope that it would just detect the files are identical and call it Synced. Backup and Sync tried to reupload everything results in duplication. ---------- 2 - Deleting folders on GDrive, didn't delete it in Google Photos so my memory was used up and it stopped uploading (I found this out having left the computer running for a day), it took me 2 hours to find diagnose this issue.------ 3 - Deleting files from GPhotos requires you to shift click, but you can't just drag the scroll bar instead have to use the mouse wheel. Also note if you select too many at once it bugs out and only selects a portion. -------- 4 - Windows bugged out so I had to start again. This time however I decided rather than re-uploading everything I would re-download. Then use a comparsion tool to ensure everything was there. ------- 5 - Google Drive, tried to correctly download files into the empty folders I pointed at. However it didn't download all the files (in fact entire folders were empty). This persisted if I restarted the back up and sync process or followed any online advice. Moving the missing files from my off line store to these locations, resulted in them being reuploaded and duplicates existing on google drive. The automatic deduplication present in GDrive only functions when duplicates are being synced at the same time, not if a file already exists (even if its in the same folder). ------ Conclusion. I now have to delete files from GDrive and GPhotos again and re-upload. A process which will take about a week. GDrive works well at uploading files you have never uploaded before, meaning you have relative peace of mind there. Using those backups however is a headache.
